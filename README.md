# NLP_Custom_NER_Tagger
•	We need to process and modify the data into sentence format. This step has to be done for the 'train_sent' and ‘train_label’ datasets and for test datasets as well.
•	After that, we need to define the features to build the CRF model.
•	Then, we need to apply these features in each sentence of the train and the test dataset to get the feature values.
•	Once the features are computed, we need to define the target variable and then build the CRF model.
•	Then, we need to perform the evaluation using a test data set.
•	After that, we need to create a dictionary in which diseases are keys and treatments are values.
